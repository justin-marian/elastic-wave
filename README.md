# Elastic Wave

## Description

The Elastic Wave Propagation is a `MATLAB` script simulates the propagation of both **longitudinal** and **transverse** *elastic waves* through a one-dimensional medium composed of multiple bodies (oscillators). It uses the finite difference method to solve the wave equation and visualizes the displacement of the medium over time for both types of waves.

## Physical Parameters

- **`P` (Bodies):** Controls the number of bodies, influencing simulation detail.
- **`m` (Masses):** Specifies individual body masses, enabling heterogeneous simulations.
- **`k` (Stiffness):** Sets medium stiffness, impacting wave behavior.
- **`N` (Discrete Time):** Determines temporal resolution for stability and accuracy.
- **Wave Parameters:** Define amplitude, frequency, and forces for precise wave control.

## Simulation Seetings

- **Spring Constants:** Spring constants represent the stiffness of the medium and are assigned to each oscillator.
- **Discrete Time:** Time is discretized to ensure numerical stability and accuracy in the simulation.
- **Initial Displacement:** Initial displacement values for both longitudinal and transverse waves are set to zero.
- **Wave Parameters:** Parameters such as amplitude, angular frequency, and external forces are defined to drive the wave propagation.

## Boundry Conditions

- **left boundary** condition is implemented to maintain the wave's behavior at the beginning of the medium. It regulates how the **longitudinal/transverse** wave interacts with the first oscillator.
- **right boundary** condition fixes the displacement of the last oscillator, simulating a rigid boundary where no displacement is allowed.

## Wave Equations

| Equation | Description                                                                                        |

| **$$\frac{\partial^2 \eta_L}{\partial t^2} = \frac{k}{m} \frac{\partial^2 \eta_L}{\partial x^2}$$** | Describes `longitudinal` wave propagation, where the displacement **$\eta_L$** of the medium changes over time and space. It reveals how the acceleration of the medium at any point is influenced by its stiffness (**$k$**) and inertia (**$m$**). |
| **$$\frac{\partial^2 \eta_T}{\partial t^2} = \frac{k}{m} \frac{\partial^2 \eta_T}{\partial x^2}$$** | Illustrates `transverse` wave propagation, depicting how the displacement **$\eta_T$** evolves over time and space. It explains how the acceleration of the medium is determined by its stiffness (**$k$**) and mass (**$m$**), influencing the wave behavior. |

## Usage

- Define the necessary physical parameters such as:
  - the number of bodies (**P**) and
  - the array of masses (**m**).
- Run the script `elastic_wave(P, m)`.

**Example:**

```matlab
P = 120;                % Number of bodies (oscillators)
m = ones(1, P);         % Array of masses for the bodies
m(P/2 : P) = 0.25;      % Set different masses for the bodies
elastic_wave(P, m);     % Run the script
```
